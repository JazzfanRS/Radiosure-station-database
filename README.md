# JazzfanRS-Radiosure-station-database
Deleted discussion of maintaining an automated database update of streaming radio stations for RadioSure. This Windows PC application stopped development and support in the early 2000's and in March of 2022 support for database updating stopped when the website was shutdown. Radiosure.com is still registered (and parked as of January 2024) and will redirect to an advertisement page for an online gambling site. The radiosure app and website were owned and operated by a Russian company called TheBestware Studio.

A solution has been created by RadioSure enthusiasts and have set up https://radiosure.fr to set up automatic updating again. I have no part in the operation of the website.
